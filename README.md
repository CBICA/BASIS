# BASIS

The CMake Build system And Software Implementation Standard (BASIS) makes it easy to create sharable software and libraries that work together. This is accomplished by combining and documenting some of the best practices, utilities, and open source projects available. More importantly, BASIS supplies a fully integrated suite of functionality to make the whole process seamless!
